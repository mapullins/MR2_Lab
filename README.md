# MR2_Lab
This is a personal project to uncover the underlying formula used by the 1999 video game Monster Rancher 2 when combining (in-game mechanic) monsters. Included are some data sets compiled, data sets created from gameplay, python scripts used to organize the data, and analysis.

## General Information
Data about the monsters comes from the (now offline) http://www.monsterrancher.com (formly Monster Rancher Metropolis) and from the combining guide by Kurasu Soratobu found at https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197977-monster-rancher-2/faqs/41787.

## Technologies
* Python 3.8 (NumPy and Pandas required)
