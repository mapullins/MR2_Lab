File: Lab_Results.csv
Description: Contains data that I collected from playing Monster Rancher 2. Many of these were generated by using cheat codes and editing hex data.

*There are basically three sets of the same series of columns. To make this easier to read, I'm including # to indicate a blank. The blank being filled with
a 1 means the first monster in the combination, 2 means the second monster in the combination, and no number indicates the offspring of the combination.*

Columns:
Main #: Main breed
Sub #: Sub breed
Lif #: Life stat
Pow #: Power stat
Int #: Intelligence stat
Ski #: Skill stat
Spd #: Speed stat
Def #: Defense stat
Type: Rating of the combination. Explanation of rating is included in the analysis of the data
Rarity: Percent chance of getting the monster (the feature name is poorly selected - should have been 'Chance')

File: (stat_name)+'_Data_1.csv'
Description: There are six of these; one for each monster stat. The naming convention is given as the file name above (for example Lif_Data_1.csv). These are
combinations of the Total_Data.csv and Lab_Results.csv. For how the file was generated, check out the python scripts in the main folder.

Columns:
Main_Stat: First monster stat
Main_Growth: First monster stat growth
Main_Base: First monster stat base
Main_Base_Rank: First monster stat natural ranked position
Main_True_Rank: First monster stat ranked position after growth multiplier applied
*Sub denotes the second monster for the five columns above (those make up the next five columns). Result denotes the offspring*
Main_Result: If the first monster is the same as the resulting monster
Sub_Result: If the second monster is the same as the resulting monster
Type: Rating of the combination
Main: Main type of the offspring
Sub: Sub type of the offspring
Rarity: Percent chance of getting the monster
